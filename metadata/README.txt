This directory contains data used to populate registry data for LTI2 TC and TP.

These metadata are referenced by migrations found in db/migrate.

The 'tc_' and 'tp_' prefix indicate which partner is expected to receive these values.
If there is no prefix, the metadata is expected to be used by both TC and TP.
